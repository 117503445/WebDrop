## Why

[THIS!](https://twitter.com/SubinSiby/status/1264340589367029760)

Case 1: I want to share files with my friend's phone or computer, but we don't have a USB cable. I have a file sharing app A, my friend have B. Both of us argue "A is better", "No, B is better". The app installation size is 50MB, is half bloatware and the arguing cost us 15 minutes. If it's an iPhone & an Android, ohnooooo. Bonus: iPhone + Android + Windows PC together ðŸ™‚

Case 2: I want to copy a text from my phone to computer, arghhðŸ˜« I have to open WhatsApp Web/Telegram now, send a message to myself -_- ðŸ˜’

Both the above problems are solved with [WebDrop](https://ShareThisFile.Online). Simply open the website on any number of your devices (even simultaneously) and share files & messages !
